abstract: |-
  Subsurface voids on the Moon and
  Mars are attractive targets for exploration, for potential
  human use, and, in the case of Mars, for the search for
  evidence of extant or past life. Orbiting satellite data
  have been used to identify more than a thousand
  candidate cave entrances on each of these planetary
  bodies. While planetary cave access has many
  challenges, rapidly evolving technologies will soon
  make the concept of a mission to one of these caves
  feasible rather than an imagining of science fiction.
  Here, we present results of robotic exercises from
  ongoing field deployments to a volcanic cave, a
  terrestrial analog for planetary lava tubes. The
  motivation for this work derives from the NASA
  BRAILLE PSTAR project. The capabilities tested and
  described have been developed over the past three years
  by JPLâ€™s CoSTAR Team, winners of the second phase
  of the current DARPA SubT Challenge.
