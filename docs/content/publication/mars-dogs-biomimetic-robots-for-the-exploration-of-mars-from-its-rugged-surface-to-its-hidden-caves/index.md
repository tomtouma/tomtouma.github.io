  The current autonomous mobility systems for planetary exploration are wheeled
  rovers, limited to

  flat, gently-sloping terrains and agglomerate regolith. These vehicles cannot tolerate instability and

  operate within a low risk envelope (i.e., low-incline driving to avoid toppling). Here, we present

  ‘Mars Dogs’ (MD), four-legged robotic dogs, the next evolution of extreme planetary exploration.

  MD is a novel system concept for acquiring science return from hard-to-access planetary surface &

  subsurface regions. MDs can negotiate extreme terrains using unique failure-recovery behaviors,

  providing a major breakthrough in planetary traversability. MDs are lightweight, compact, and

  fast-moving compared to Perseverance: 2.6% volume, 4.6% mass, and 38 times faster. A pack of

  MDs consists of three individual robotic units: one (Alpha-MD) equipped with a deep cave

  exploration payload including an arm; and two (Tether-MD) equipped with a tethering system. One

  of the units carries a MMRTG power supply. Each MD is equipped with sensors and deployable

  communication nodes to facilitate live, subterranean-to-surface data transmission.

  Mars Dogs operate in synergy, exhibiting collaborative mobility behaviours to accomplish diverse

  missions that cannot be fulfilled by a single robot. An array of lava tubes on the southeastern flank of

  Pavonis Mons in the Tharsis Region of Mars offers an ideal location to release a pack of Mars Dogs.

  This region is of interest to scientists as it offers access to the Mars subsurface, where evidence of

  past or extant life may persist, and a potential shelter to future human inhabitants.

  The MD concept has evolved from our experience using the stable and nimble Boston

  Dynamics “Spot” quadruped. We endowed Spot with a high-level autonomy/AI framework referred

  to as “NeBula”, developed by our JPL/Caltech Team CoSTAR. Our “Autonomous Spot” platform

  has advanced the current state-of-the-art in legged exploration and traversal of extreme and

  subsurface environments, propelling us to a 1st-place finish in the 2020 DARPA Subterranean

  Challenge with a system similar to that which we envision for Mars Dogs. Through partnership with

  the NASA BRAILLE Team, we will apply this technology to the exploration of lava tubes in N.

  California, an analog environment for future missions to volcanic caves on Mars.
