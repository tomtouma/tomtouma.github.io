Hi! I'm a research scientist at Caltech. <!--I'm also an affiliate roboticist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.--> My work involves R&D on autonomous quadrupeds, drones, and space robots. I have professional experience in robotic hardware design, microcontroller system firmware, and robotic software implementation. I've had the privilege of working at JPL and NASA on various projects including the [DARPA Subterranean Challenge](https://www.subtchallenge.com/), [](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/OMEGA/index.html)[OMEGA Project](https://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/research/OMEGA/index.html), [NeBula AI solution](https://costar.jpl.nasa.gov/), [BRAILLE](https://nasa-braille.org/) and more. My current focus is on creating resilient and autonomous robotic systems for exploration of complex environments on Earth and other celestial bodies. 

When I'm not at work, I'm back home on my farm with my squad (my five mischievous hunting dogs), riding dirt bikes, flying drones, weightlifting, tinkering with machinery, hanging with my grandparents, and working on the farm.
