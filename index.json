MDs can negotiate extreme terrains using unique failure-recovery behaviors,\nproviding a major breakthrough in planetary traversability. MDs are lightweight, compact, and\nfast-moving compared to Perseverance: 2.6% volume, 4.6% mass, and 38 times faster. A pack of\nMDs consists of three individual robotic units: one (Alpha-MD) equipped with a deep cave\nexploration payload including an arm; and two (Tether-MD) equipped with a tethering system.

Communication in these environments is difficult due to non-line-of-sight multipath environments. Constructing reliable communication systems is a critical element in enabling efficient robotic operations in subsurface voids. We developed a multi-robot communications system named CHORD (Collaborative High-bandwidth Operations with Radio Droppables). CHORD enables a team of robots to form a  mobile  ad-hoc  network using  range-limited wireless devices. There are two types of agents in CHORD, mobile robots and semi-mobile communication nodes which are carried and deployed. The nodes serve to enable three different purposes: (i) Communication: reliable and low latency communication between agents and robots on surface (ii) Positioning: ranging measurements from each node help mobile agent positioning inside GPS-denied (on terrestrial applications) and orbiter-denied (in planetary setting) environment (iii) Science measurements: the measurement of certain phenomenon in multiple locations simultaneously.  This enables deeper understanding of the spatial temporal phenomenons in subsurface voids and caves. CHORD supports dynamic changes in network topology, advanced routing, and network QoS (Quality of Service). We developed communication-aware planning algorithms that strategically deploy on-board communication relays by taking into consideration the geometry of the environment, terrain type, and other characteristics that affect communication quality and reliability. CHORD has been developed at JPL and demonstrated in an underground environment as part of Team CoSTAR’s solution at the 2020 DARPA Subterranean that won 1st place. In this event, CHORD enabled reliable communications for robot exploration missions hundreds of meters into an underground environment, via a mesh network consisting of dropped communication nodes. The mesh network enabled high bandwidth data transmission to the base station for live-monitoring, teleoperation and collaborative 3D topology map building. In this presentation, we will describe our CHORD system and show a promising application for future planetary subsurface exploration.","tags":null,"title":"Deployable Mesh Network for Enabling Reliable Communication from within Subsurface Voids to the Planetary Surface","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hyungho Chris Choi","Inhwan Wee","Micah Corah","Sahand Sabet","Taeyeon Kim","Thomas Touma","David Hyunchul Shim","Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1638321430,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1638321430,"objectID":"c7f84fca9af6a2215314354e5b2ebad2","permalink":"https://tomtouma.github.io/publication/baxter-bi-modal-aerial-terrestrial-hybrid-vehicle-for-long-endurance-versatile-mobility/","publishdate":"2021-12-01T01:17:10.548Z","relpermalink":"/publication/baxter-bi-modal-aerial-terrestrial-hybrid-vehicle-for-long-endurance-versatile-mobility/","section":"publication","summary":"Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly evolving within the\nfield of robotics. However, their performance is often limited by pay-\nload capacity, operational time, and robustness to impact and collision.\nThese limitations of aerial vehicles become more acute for missions in\nchallenging environments such as subterranean structures which may re-\nquire extended autonomous operation in confined spaces. While software\nsolutions for aerial robots are developing rapidly, improvements to hard-\nware are critical to applying advanced planners and algorithms in large\nand dangerous environments where the short range and high suscepti-\nbility to collisions of most modern aerial robots make applications in\nrealistic subterranean missions infeasible.

Extensive flight\ntests were conducted to characterize the vehicle’s capabilities, including\nrobustness and endurance.

On the other hand,\nground robots are able to carry larger payloads and have a lower\ncost of transport, at the price of limited mobility over challenging terrain. This paper presents a hybrid aerial/ground vehicle\nthat combines the capabilities of both types of vehicles to enable\nmulti-modal mobility in diverse and challenging environments,\na lower cost of transport compared to purely aerial vehicles,\nincreased payload capacity, and a design that is more robust to\ncollisions and physical interaction within potentially cluttered\nand narrow spaces. The design consists of a UAV with four\nindependently actuated spherical wheels which, in addition to\nproviding traction for ground mobility, protect the propellers in\ncollision. In comparison to hybrid vehicles with passive wheels\npresented in other designs, actuated wheels mitigates perception\ndegradation in dusty environments caused by downwash from\nthrusting close to the ground. In addition, the integration of\nan end-to-end autonomy stack is presented which enables the\ncontrol, planning, and autonomous navigation of the hybrid\nvehicle in unknown environments. The controls framework employs a geometric tracking controller for aerial trajectories and\na cascaded position and velocity controller for ground mobility.\nWe leverage motion primitives to locally plan collision-free paths\nand a differential flatness mapping to generate kinodynamically\nfeasible trajectories for both terrestrial and aerial modalities in\na unified manner. Lastly, we utilize a grid based A* search and\nprobabilistic 3D mapping based on octrees to plan geometric\naerial/ground paths to a goal. With this framework, we hope to\ndemonstrate the capabilities of this hybrid aerial/ground vehicle\nin challenging unknown environments and improved energy\nefficiency for hybrid mobility over purely flying.\n","tags":null,"title":"Drivocopter: A concept Hybrid Aerial/Ground vehicle for long-endurance mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;\rif porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;:\rprint(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)\r  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}}\r{{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}\r Press Space to play!\nOne \r**Two** \rThree \r A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}}\r- Only the speaker can read these notes\r- Press `S` key to view\r{{% /speaker_note %}}\r Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r{{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}\r  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1,\r.reveal section h2,\r.reveal section h3 {\rcolor: navy;\r}\r  Questions?

People are now looking for solutions and finding ways to\nmore efficiently use what we currently consider wastes as they are among the most\npromising resources. This idea is particularly relevant to farmers who already use manure\nfrom their livestock as fertilizer and for making biogas—we think they can do more.\nThe OMEGA Farm Project proposes to use ponds on farms to create a link\nbetween animal manure and energy, feed/food, and clean water to improve the overall\nefficiency and economics of animal farming. It works by dispersing manure from pigs,\ncows, or chickens in water to make a nutrient-rich liquid and a carbon-rich sludge. The\nliquid is clarified by electrocoagulation (EC) and used to cultivate fast-growing microalgae\nin photobioreactors (PBRs) floating in a nearby pond. The sludge is used for biogas and\nCO2 production in anaerobic digesters (AD) on land or in the pond. The biogas produced\nin the AD is used for heat, electricity, and CO2 that contribute to algae growth. The algae\nbiomass is feed for the livestock on the farm or for caged fish grown in the pond. The\nalgae and fish wastewater is processed by filtration and reverse osmosis to provide water\nfor the livestock, while the retentate from the water purification is cycled back to the PBRs\nor to the AD. Water-cooled solar panels and wind turbines provide additional energy as\nheat and electricity.\nOur experiments and calculations done during the internship support the feasibility\nof the OMEGA Farm concept. We measured nutrients (NH3/PO4) in the extracted liquid\nand calculated the amount of CO2 produced in the AD plus combustion of biogas. Our\nresults suggest the OMEGA Farm Project will help close loops between waste, food,\nwater, and energy, which should improve the overall economics of animal farms.","tags":[],"title":"NASA OMEGA/UpCycle Systems: M-Powered Farm Project","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://tomtouma.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
