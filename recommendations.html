      <li><span style='color: #2dedb7'>Benjamin Morrell,</span>
        <b>Robotics Technologist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory:</b>
        <i>"Thomas and I worked together in the JPL-MIT-Caltech team in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge, where I
          lead the perception sub-team. Thomas was our go-to hardware person for all things electronics, mechanical,
          and firmware. I honestly can't think of anything Thomas can't do. We would often come to Thomas with highly
          ambitious hardware requests and extremely tight deadlines (even 24 hours in some circumstances). Time after
          time, Thomas delivered on schedule and with practical, innovative designs that proved successful in the field.
          His ability to rapidly complete produce prototypes from the ground-up is remarkable, and an invaluable asset to
          the team. Further, he is an absolute pleasure to work with, being collaborative, empathetic, and level headed in
          all circumstances. He regularly puts others ahead of himself for the benefit of the project. I can not
          recommend Thomas highly enough and hope to continue to work with him in the future."</i>

      <li><span style='color: #2dedb7'>Angel Santamaria-Navarro,</span>
        <b>Robotics Research Technologist at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory:</b>
        <i>"I had the pleasure of working with Thomas for more than a year at NASA-JPL, within the context of DARPA
          Subterranean Challenge (CoSTAR team). The project we worked for required a very fast pace, highly advanced
          engineering solutions and scientific concepts with a technology readiness level out of reach for most institutions,
          either in the public or private sectors. We enrolled in one of the most challenging competitions in the world to
          push the boundaries of knowledge and engineering and, as a team, we did a great job. The excellence in a team
          is reached not only by having the most qualified team members, but also great human beings. In this sense, Thomas
          is the perfect team player, hard-worker and always with a smile prepared for anyone around him. He has a very good
          understanding of engineering problems that need to be addressed and provides creative solutions, feasible within
          tight deadlines."</i>

      <li><span style='color: #2dedb7'>Torkom Pailevanian,</span>
        <b>Robotics Electronics Engineer at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory:</b>
        <i>"I had the pleasure of working with Thomas during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. I was leading the hardware
          team for JPL and he was part of my group. Our job was to build the autonomy payloads and vehicles which would be
          used for the competition. Thomas is a man of many talents. He is a Solidworks wiz and is very familiar with 3D
          printing and other forms of rapid prototyping. In addition, he does electronics prototyping and writes Arduino
          code to bring R&D concepts to working prototypes. He is thorough and thinks through the many details of his
          designs, from functionality to manufacturability. He is a kind and very respectful individual. He is devoted to
          his tasks and has an incredible work ethic, coming in nights and weekends to get things done."</i>

        <b>Robotics Engineer at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory:</b>
        <i>"Thomas is a hard working engineer. He will stick with the project until the job is done and always delivers
          exceptional products. On our team he prepared the computers for our robots, including making a guard for a
          velodyne on a robot that fell down a whole flight of stairs. The velodyne was perfectly fine at the end."</i>
