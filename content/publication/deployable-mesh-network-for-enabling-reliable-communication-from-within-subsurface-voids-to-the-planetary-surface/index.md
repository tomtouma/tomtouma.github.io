abstract: "Exploring Planetary subsurface voids is important for research in
  astrobiology, geophysics and human habitability. Communication in these
  environments is difficult due to non-line-of-sight multipath environments.
  Constructing reliable communication systems is a critical element in enabling
  efficient robotic operations in subsurface voids. We developed a multi-robot
  communications system named CHORD (Collaborative High-bandwidth Operations
  with Radio Droppables). CHORD enables a team of robots to form
  a  mobile  ad-hoc  network using  range-limited wireless devices. There are
  two types of agents in CHORD, mobile robots and semi-mobile communication
  nodes which are carried and deployed. The nodes serve to enable three
  different purposes: (i) Communication: reliable and low latency communication
  between agents and robots on surface (ii) Positioning: ranging measurements
  from each node help mobile agent positioning inside GPS-denied (on terrestrial
  applications) and orbiter-denied (in planetary setting) environment (iii)
  Science measurements: the measurement of certain phenomenon in multiple
  locations simultaneously.  This enables deeper understanding of the spatial
  temporal phenomenons in subsurface voids and caves. CHORD supports dynamic
  changes in network topology, advanced routing, and network QoS (Quality of
  Service). We developed communication-aware planning algorithms that
  strategically deploy on-board communication relays by taking into
  consideration the geometry of the environment, terrain type, and other
  characteristics that affect communication quality and reliability. CHORD has
  been developed at JPL and demonstrated in an underground environment as part
  of Team CoSTARâ€™s solution at the 2020 DARPA Subterranean that won 1st place.
  In this event, CHORD enabled reliable communications for robot exploration
  missions hundreds of meters into an underground environment, via a mesh
  network consisting of dropped communication nodes. The mesh network enabled
  high bandwidth data transmission to the base station for live-monitoring,
  teleoperation and collaborative 3D topology map building. In this
  presentation, we will describe our CHORD system and show a promising
  application for future planetary subsurface exploration."
