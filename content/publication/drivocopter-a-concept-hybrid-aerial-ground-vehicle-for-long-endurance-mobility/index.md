  Aerial robots show promise for increased capabilities in exploring
  unstructured and challenging environments.

  However, they are limited by payload capacity, flight times, and

  susceptibility to damage in case of collision. On the other hand,

  ground robots are able to carry larger payloads and have a lower

  cost of transport, at the price of limited mobility over challenging terrain. This paper presents a hybrid aerial/ground vehicle

  that combines the capabilities of both types of vehicles to enable

  multi-modal mobility in diverse and challenging environments,

  a lower cost of transport compared to purely aerial vehicles,

  increased payload capacity, and a design that is more robust to

  collisions and physical interaction within potentially cluttered

  and narrow spaces. The design consists of a UAV with four

  independently actuated spherical wheels which, in addition to

  providing traction for ground mobility, protect the propellers in

  collision. In comparison to hybrid vehicles with passive wheels

  presented in other designs, actuated wheels mitigates perception

  degradation in dusty environments caused by downwash from

  thrusting close to the ground. In addition, the integration of

  an end-to-end autonomy stack is presented which enables the

  control, planning, and autonomous navigation of the hybrid

  vehicle in unknown environments. The controls framework employs a geometric tracking controller for aerial trajectories and

  a cascaded position and velocity controller for ground mobility.

  We leverage motion primitives to locally plan collision-free paths

  and a differential flatness mapping to generate kinodynamically

  feasible trajectories for both terrestrial and aerial modalities in

  a unified manner. Lastly, we utilize a grid based A* search and

  probabilistic 3D mapping based on octrees to plan geometric

  aerial/ground paths to a goal. With this framework, we hope to

  demonstrate the capabilities of this hybrid aerial/ground vehicle

  in challenging unknown environments and improved energy

  efficiency for hybrid mobility over purely flying.
