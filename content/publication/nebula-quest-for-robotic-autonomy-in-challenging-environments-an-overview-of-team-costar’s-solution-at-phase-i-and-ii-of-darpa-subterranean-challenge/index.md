  This paper presents and discusses algorithms, hardware, and software
  architecture developed

  by the TEAM CoSTAR (Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Robots), competing in

  the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. Specifically, it presents the techniques utilized within

  the Tunnel (2019) and Urban (2020) competitions, where CoSTAR achieved 2nd and 1st

  place, respectively. We also discuss CoSTAR’s demonstrations in Martian-analog surface and

  subsurface (lava tubes) exploration. The paper introduces our autonomy solution, referred to

  as NeBula (Networked Belief-aware Perceptual Autonomy). NeBula is an uncertainty-aware

  framework that aims at enabling resilient and modular autonomy solutions by performing

  reasoning and decision making in the belief space (space of probability distributions over

  the robot and world states). We discuss various components of the NeBula framework,

  including: (i) geometric and semantic environment mapping; (ii) a multi-modal positioning

  system; (iii) traversability analysis and local planning; (iv) global motion planning and

  exploration behavior; (v) risk-aware mission planning; (vi) networking and decentralized

  reasoning; and (vii) learning-enabled adaptation. We discuss the performance of NeBula on

  several robot types (e.g. wheeled, legged, flying), in various environments. We discuss the

  specific results and lessons learned from fielding this solution in the challenging courses of

  the DARPA Subterranean Challenge competition.
