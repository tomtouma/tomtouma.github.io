  The world is already facing shortage of vital resources in part due to climate
  change and

  in the future it will only get worse. People are now looking for solutions and finding ways to

  more efficiently use what we currently consider wastes as they are among the most

  promising resources. This idea is particularly relevant to farmers who already use manure

  from their livestock as fertilizer and for making biogasâ€”we think they can do more.

  The OMEGA Farm Project proposes to use ponds on farms to create a link

  between animal manure and energy, feed/food, and clean water to improve the overall

  efficiency and economics of animal farming. It works by dispersing manure from pigs,

  cows, or chickens in water to make a nutrient-rich liquid and a carbon-rich sludge. The

  liquid is clarified by electrocoagulation (EC) and used to cultivate fast-growing microalgae

  in photobioreactors (PBRs) floating in a nearby pond. The sludge is used for biogas and

  CO2 production in anaerobic digesters (AD) on land or in the pond. The biogas produced

  in the AD is used for heat, electricity, and CO2 that contribute to algae growth. The algae

  biomass is feed for the livestock on the farm or for caged fish grown in the pond. The

  algae and fish wastewater is processed by filtration and reverse osmosis to provide water

  for the livestock, while the retentate from the water purification is cycled back to the PBRs

  or to the AD. Water-cooled solar panels and wind turbines provide additional energy as

  heat and electricity.

  Our experiments and calculations done during the internship support the feasibility

  of the OMEGA Farm concept. We measured nutrients (NH3/PO4) in the extracted liquid

  and calculated the amount of CO2 produced in the AD plus combustion of biogas. Our

  results suggest the OMEGA Farm Project will help close loops between waste, food,

  water, and energy, which should improve the overall economics of animal farms.
