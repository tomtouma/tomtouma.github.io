abstract: >-
  This paper serves as one of the first efforts to

  enable large-scale and long-duration autonomy using the Boston

  Dynamics Spot robot. Motivated by exploring extreme environments, particularly those involved in the DARPA Subterranean

  Challenge, this paper pushes the boundaries of the state-ofpractice in enabling legged robotic systems to accomplish realworld complex missions in relevant scenarios. In particular, we

  discuss the behaviors and capabilities which emerge from the

  integration of the autonomy architecture NeBula (Networked

  Belief-aware Perceptual Autonomy) with next-generation mobility systems. We will discuss the hardware and software

  challenges, and solutions in mobility, perception, autonomy, and

  very briefly, wireless networking, as well as lessons learned

  and future directions. We demonstrate the performance of the

  proposed solutions on physical systems in real-world scenarios.3

  The proposed solution contributed to winning 1st-place in the

  2020 DARPA Subterranean Challenge, Urban Circuit.
