BRAILLE is a research project funded by NASA’s *Planetary Science and Technology through Analog Research* ([PSTAR](https://astrobiology.nasa.gov/research/astrobiology-at-nasa/pstar/)) program. The project’s objectives are to characterize microbial life and its life signatures (biological, mineralogical, and chemical) within volcanic caves, demonstrate sub-surface activities using robots in a Mars Mission scenario, and assess the performance of the robot-mounted scientific instruments in low or no light settings to explore, map, and assist in remote astrobiology science.
