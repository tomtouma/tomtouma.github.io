abstract: |-
  Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly evolving within the
  field of robotics. However, their performance is often limited by pay-
  load capacity, operational time, and robustness to impact and collision.
  These limitations of aerial vehicles become more acute for missions in
  challenging environments such as subterranean structures which may re-
  quire extended autonomous operation in confined spaces. While software
  solutions for aerial robots are developing rapidly, improvements to hard-
  ware are critical to applying advanced planners and algorithms in large
  and dangerous environments where the short range and high suscepti-
  bility to collisions of most modern aerial robots make applications in
  realistic subterranean missions infeasible. To provide such hardware ca-
  pabilities, one needs to design and implement a hardware solution that
  takes into the account the Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints.
  This work focuses on providing a robust and versatile hybrid platform
  that improves payload capacity, operation time, endurance, and versa-
  tility. The Bi-modal Aerial and Terrestrial hybrid vehicle (BAXTER) is
  a solution that provides two modes of operation, aerial and terrestrial.
  BAXTER employs two novel hardware mechanisms: the M-Suspension
  and the Decoupled Transmission which together provide resilience during
  landing and crashes and efficient terrestrial operation. Extensive flight
  tests were conducted to characterize the vehicle’s capabilities, including
  robustness and endurance. Additionally, we propose Agile Mode Trans-
  fer (AMT), a transition from aerial to terrestrial operation that seeks
  to minimize impulses during impact to the ground which is a quick and
  simple transition process that exploits BAXTER’s resilience to impact.
